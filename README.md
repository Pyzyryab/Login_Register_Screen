# Login Register Screen

Free Python login register screen for your projects

## How it's made?

This program is made in Tkinter/Tcl. It's a pretty simple tech but it's worth your time while you are learning Python GUI.

## What features have?

- Custom titlebar, avoiding (if you desire) native OS window border implementation.
- Full integrated with a little `sqlite3`database. You can create users since the moment on what you clone this project and start play with the program.
- Complete separated parts of the program, avoiding python files with > 1000 lines of code, which ends with a more debuggleable code.
- Everything is a `custom widget`. That's a non-native Python feature implemented thought OOP, trying to gap close Flutter UI's in a basic level.
- You can integrate it in almost every single project where you need a Login/Register Screen.
- It could be easily upgraded to interact with REST API endpoint's, or authenticate users on a external DB or throught technologies like Django-Admin.
